        <h2> Hatteras Island, NC</h2>
        <p> Ever since the age of two, I have traveled to Hatteras Island with my family. The barrier island rests at the tip of the Outer Banks, roughly thirty miles from the mainland. My family and I go every summer in late June or eary July. This summer, my parents, sister, dog, and I came the last week in June, then my grandparents joined us at the beach for the Fourth of July. </p>
