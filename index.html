        <h2> Baton Twirling</h2>
        <p>This image depicts baton twirling, a sport of which I have been passionately involved in since the age of 11. I possess the ability to twirl one, two, and three batons. Throughout my baton career, I have served as a majorette, traveled to competitions, and partaken in twirling clinics with the West Virginia University Feature Twirlers. Now, in addition to twirling individually, I give lessons to aspiring majorettes and have coreographed solos for majorettes to perform. </p>
    <h2>Family</h2>  
        <p> I am very close to and possess so much love for my family. My mother, father, sister, and labrador retriever make up my family. My sister Mattie is fifteen years old and is a sophomore in high school. My dog, titled as Handsome Hatcher Walker, is called Hatcher and is five years old. I love to take Hatcher on walks. He carries his own water bottle in his mouth while he walks then drops it when he is thirsty. </p>
