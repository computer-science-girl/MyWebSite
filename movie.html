        <p>My favorite movie is Miracle, a true story based upon the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team. 20 young college-aged boys compete for Team USA, under the coach Herb Brooks, and they win the gold medal. They defeat the Sovied Union which had the best hockey team in the world at that time. I love how inspiring the movie is and the patriotism it instills. </p>
